      </p>

      <p className="text-secondary">
        Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information
        described above will depend on the personal information concerned and
        the specific context in which we collect it.
      </p>

      <p className="text-secondary">
        However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i)
        where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you;
        (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not
        overridden by your rights; or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.
        We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and
        communicating with you as necessary to provide these Services, for
        example when responding to your queries, improving our Platform,
        undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing
        illegal activities.
      </p>

      <p className="text-secondary">
        In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
        information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to
        protect your vital interests or those of another person. Osler, Hoskin
        &amp; Harcourt LLP (February 3, 2021)

        If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
        requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear
        at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your
        personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible
        consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

        We will retain your personal information as long as you continue to use
        the Services, or for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes
        outlined in this Privacy Policy. Even after you delete your Account, we
        may retain copies of information about you for a period of time that is
        consistent with applicable law, applicable statute of limitations or as
        we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law,
        regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to collect fees
        owed, to resolve disputes, to address problems with our services, to
        assist with investigations, to enforce our Terms or other applicable
        agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with
        applicable law. For non-EEA residents and where permitted by law, we may

        Protection Act. If you believe that your child under 13 has gained
        access to the Services without your permission, you may request the
        deletion of their personal information by contacting us at
        privacy@horizon.io. If we learn that we have collected personal
        information about a child under age 13, we will delete that data as
        quickly as possible. We have taken commercially reasonable steps to
        restrict use of the Services to those who are at least 13 years old. We

        DNT signals.
